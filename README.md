# Why this stack
- Fast, visual terminal (Kitty): GPU‑accelerated, image previews (icat), smooth cursor trail.
- Modern editor (NvChad v3 on Neovim): IDE‑like UX with LSP, Treesitter, and Lazy for plugins.
- Ergonomic shell (Zsh + Oh‑My‑Zsh): Clean agnoster prompt, syntax highlighting, autosuggestions.
- Looks right everywhere (Nerd/Powerline fonts): Consistent icons and ligatures across tools.
- Multiplexing when you need it (tmux/Zellij): Stable sessions, split panes, remote‑friendly workflows.
- One‑command bootstrap: Reproducible macOS/Linux setup for the same experience on every machine.
- Opinionated but extensible: Sensible defaults you can tweak without fighting the config.
